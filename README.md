# Printer Paper Jam Troubleshooting
## Description
Using access to the paper tray and/or rear panel, locate the paper jam. Use both hands to firmly pull the paper out. Once all panels and drawers are back in place, the printer should no longer display the issue.
## Steps to Troubleshoot
1. Remove the troubled paper tray from the printer and set it asside.
2. With the use of a flashlight, observe inside the paper tray slot for the paper jam.
3. When the jam is located, grasp the sheet with both hands and firmly pull until the paper is removed. **(If the paper is out of reach from the front, you may have a _duplex printer_. Open the rear panel on the back of the printer to access the duplex system and locate the paper there.)**
4. Clean any remaining scraps of paper from the device left behind.
5. Close any panels you opened and place the paper tray back into posistion.
6. The printer will scan itself for the issue.
7. If the jam is resolved, normal functionality will return to the device.
### Definitions
Duplex Printer - A printer capable of printing on both side of the paper automatically without requiring human interaction during the process.
## Conclusion
It is important when troubleshooting a paper jam to remember the problem is accesible from either the front or back of the printer depending on the model and you must have both hands on the paper when pulling to reduce the likelyhood of paper scraps or debris.
